Focus on accesibility testing lightning web components

## What is accesibity testing

Accesibility testing can be seen as a testing approach, which is very relevant when dealing with user interfaces. We will focus on what is accesible. What can the user see, touch, hear, taste. What is simply accesible to the user.

### Example -- Button Click

A very naive example of an accesible UI feature would be a button. 
1. First accesibility issue would be what does the button look like.
2. Secondly is the button "clickable". Can we interact with the native browser event of "onclick".
3. Lastly what is the result of the button click and is the result accessible.

This would be a simple approach to accesibility testing a button. So lets put it into practice.
